# cars

This program gives a user three options. The first allows the user to add a car to the list of cars. The second allows the user to view the list of cars in order of year. The third allows the user to quit the program.

I worked with Sofia Bejerano, Jessie Roux, and Mica Marietta on this project. I also got help from a website (https://askubuntu.com/questions/1705/how-can-i-create-a-select-menu-in-a-shell-script) to learn how to create a selection menu in shell script.
